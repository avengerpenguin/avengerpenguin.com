    <h1>ENTP Productivity</h1>
    

    <p>I have a few descriptors that have been useful over the years to describe my neurotype and approaches to life.</p>
<p>Whether we call it <a href="https://personalityjunkie.com/entp/">ENTP</a>, <a href="https://odderbeing.com/about-hyperlinkers/">Hyperlinker</a> or <a href="https://www.belbin.com/about/belbin-team-roles">Plant</a>, I have worked a lot on how best to structure my days and work to go with the grain of the underlying neurotype at play here (rather than constantly fight it).</p>
<h2 id="problems-we-encounter">Problems we encounter</h2>
<p>The main problem is being good at understanding things quickly and starting things -- including finding new ways to come at things -- seems to be anathema to being able to finish and follow through.</p>
<h2 id="possible-causes">Possible causes</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://sensingsage.com/getting-this-done-entp-productivity/">How to be Organized as ENTP</a> it is hypothesised the issue is a natural outcome of that strength to see new ideas and possibilites. That is, it is hard to <em>stop</em> seeing them even when trying to following through on an existing plan.</p>
<p>This attention problem arguably puts these traits on the spectrum for ADHD. Whether ADHD is actually diagnosable or not, the methods for coping with it have a strange habit of being applicable for those identifying with decriptors like ENTP or Hyperlinker.</p>
<p>The article above goes on to present a tension between being good at coming up with systems, but then a spiral emerges where intution keeps trying to pull you away from a prescribed plan.</p>
<h2 id="solutions-to-try">Solutions to try</h2>
<p>Again, from <a href="https://sensingsage.com/getting-this-done-entp-productivity/">How to be Organized as ENTP</a>, the solutions suggested are generally to keep things minimalist and simple.</p>
<h3 id="daily-tasks">Daily Tasks</h3>
<p>Use Bullet Journalling. Or at least some way to distill down a summary 2-10 things that need done <em>today</em> and defer the rest.</p>
<p>I have gone back and forth on that approach and the biggest benefit I found was the chore of having to re-write a carried-over tasks would eventually frustrate me to the point of doing the task right now or perhaps just dropping it as it's clearly not valuable to me.</p>
<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<p>There can be a lot of risk of being too busy to keep in touch with people. Also, we can end up with large lists of acquaintances without keeping in touch with actual friends.</p>
<p>The minimalist consideration here is to focus on a small list of people that make you happy.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>I have found that projects are hard to manage in a Bullet Journal system. The "Getting Things Done" approach just has a big list of projects and -- at least for me -- this can be quite a large list.</p>
<p>One solution here is to manage it more like a software product backlog, notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be clear on what is not being worked on right now</li>
<li>A clear project will have an end in mind</li>
<li>A minimalist approach is to define an MVP for each project</li>
<li>Therefore when you add tasks to a project, you can drop or at least park activities that don't directly feed into that MVP</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things">Things</h3>
<p>I have found I can have a clearer focus in more minimalist surroundings like hotel rooms. I have read <a href="https://amzn.to/313DMa6">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying</a> which inspired me to declutter quite a lot of things.</p>
<h3 id="browsers-tabs-and-bookmarks">Browsers tabs and bookmarks</h3>
<p>I keep a lot of browser tabs open for things I plan to "come back to". One thing that helped me here is the Todoist browser extension where I can quick-add any web page to my Inbox or any project and then I can close the tab.</p>
<p>Another technique is writing this right now. Any links I want to keep for "reference" are now instead transferred into my Digital Garden as either a short note or a longer article as I grow my own thoughts around it and connect it to related articles.</p>
<p>Writing this allowed me to close the tab for <a href="https://sensingsage.com/getting-this-done-entp-productivity/">How To be Organized as ENTP</a> at the very least.</p>
