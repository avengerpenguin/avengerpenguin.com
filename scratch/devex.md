"We shape our tools and our tools shape us"

DevOps is a special case of DevEx (i.e. hyponym)

Agile: observe, experiment, improve

DevEx: Spirit of Agile in our tooling

DevOps -> CI
Agile -> Retro
DevEx -> Atomist and other tools


People control the setup and need visibility

Moving things below the human/machine line moves things fro humans to
instructions -> safer, traceable, repeatable, smooth

Automation augments decision-making with inforamtion and carrying-out

Don't move decisions below the line
