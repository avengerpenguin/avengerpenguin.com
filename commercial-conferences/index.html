    <h1>Commercial Conferences</h1>
    

    <p>I use the term "Commercial Conferences" for tech conferences set up by a single company (or a small number collaborating) where the agenda is clearly going to focus around their products.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily a bad thing as if their products are solving problems in a space you're interested in, they can put on talks with topics that are useful still.</p>
<p>I think there's a couple of "drag factors" that almost inevitably detract from the quality not because they are trying to do a bad job, but just because of the nature of the setup.</p>
<h2 id="repetition">Repetition</h2>
<p>If a schedule is filled with different people from the same company, almost every talk will come back to their product and how it solves the problem the talk was discussing.</p>
<p>Not necessarily bad in isolation, but over the course of a whole conference, it becomes a little repetitive, much like any advert you encounter multiple times.</p>
<p>This is especially notable when the "plug" comes near the end, since it makes every talk an inevitable journey to the same destination, albeit from different starting points. This leads into the next issue.</p>
<p>It's true that even in a more "general" conference, most people have been sent to speak for their company and mention their company's products, but at least the worst case here is each talk is an advert for a different product. There's some variety and I can compare things I've seen that day.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-breadth">Lack of Breadth</h2>
<p>If I attend a talk discussing a problem or an area of interest, I expect a little bit of exploration of the space and different solutions. The talk might be demonstrating one particular solution in some cases, but I'd like to see how it compares to other things.</p>
<p>Where a talk is fated to end up pitching a particular product, there are times where I can sense it's come at the expense of exploring other options, the drawbacks to their solution or even how it compares to other things (since as an advert it needs to be careful about comparisons to other products that turn out not to be true).</p>
<p>This might seem like it's just an extension of the "repetition" issue, but I think it highlights a deeper consequence where talks that are too commercially-driven will have almost an upper limit of how intellectually rich they can be. That is, they can only frame the problem in terms of how their product addresses it, they can't be open to whether the problem doesn't even need solved or if it's a problem we could be avoiding having in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="hard-sell">Hard Sell</h2>
<p>This one is not an inevitable problem as such, but it does come up now and again.</p>
<p>It might be something I notice more as a British person attending talks delivered by an American company where some of the sales patter, jokes and other quirks come across as insincere. It's as if it's a bit more impolite to be too "full on" with a sales pitch in the UK.</p>
<p>I've seen talks where there's lip service to some kind of structure, e.g. a quick "history of this topic" that is riddled with oversimplifications, in service of trying to get to the sales pitch. When it's really obvious, at wish they would at least dress up their sales pitch with a genuinely interesting discussion.</p>
<p>At one conference, a lot of the speakers seemed quite over-rehearsed and professional to that point of insincerity again. This might be creeping into personal preference, but the best talks in my view are people that know their stuff, have something to say and just deliver it as their genuine selves.</p>
