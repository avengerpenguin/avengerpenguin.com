<p>Public speaking is not just speaking in public. It is storytelling.

</blockquote>
<h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
<h3 id="message">Message</h3>
<p>"What do I want people to walk away knowing/thinking/feeling?"</p>
<p>Anticipate what might prevent that.</p>
<h3 id="tone">Tone</h3>
<p>Is this talk funny? Serious? Informative?</p>
<p>Match tone to the message. Don't use humour if announcing redundancies.</p>
<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>
<p>To whom am I talking and what are their priorities?</p>
<h2 id="story-structures">Story Structures</h2>
<h3 id="beginning">Beginning</h3>
<p>Hardest part.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find your narrative arc</li>
<li>Define beginning and end</li>
<li>Then fill in the middle</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heros-journeymonolith">Hero's Journey/Monolith</h3>
<p>Hero leaves home for a difficult journey. Comes home with wisdom.</p>
<p>"My journey from high-school dropout to CEO of a fortune 500 company"</p>
<h3 id="the-mountain">The Mountain</h3>
<p>Like hero's journey, but not always a happy ending. Building tensions, overcoming obstacles.</p>
<p>"I was born to a single mother in rural Mississippi and my highest aspiration was to one day be a maid like my grandmother" - Oprah</p>
<h3 id="nested-loops">Nested Loops</h3>
<p>Three or more narratives layered within each other.</p>
<p>Core story at the centre and others elaborate on it. First story you begin is the last you finish.</p>
<p>"Growing up, I faced many obstacles... I had a 2nd grade teacher who taught me... What I learned was..."</p>
<p>Titanic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old woman</li>
<li>Jack and wossname</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sparklines">Sparklines</h3>
<p>Structure often contrast ordinary with extraordinary/ideal.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs: unveils iPhone. Talks about clunky reality of phones and paints a picture of what it could be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspiring the audience to action</li>
<li>Creating hope and excitement</li>
<li>Creating a following</li>
</ul>
<p>"Imagine a world where deploys take 2s... What if tests took only 30s to write..."</p>
<p>MLK "I have a dream" -- contrasting dream world with reality.</p>
<h3 id="in-medias-res">In Medias Res</h3>
<p>Narrative begins in the heat of the action, then starts over at the beginning.</p>
<p>Good for short presentations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grabs attention from the start.</li>
</ul>
<p>"I never thought one semi-colon would cause the destruction of my company..."</p>
<h3 id="converging-ideas">Converging Ideas</h3>
<p>Structure that shows the audience how different strands came together.</p>
<p>"How did a philosopher, an English hacker, a CSS MAster and a db wizard come together to create of the biggest software success stories? Twice."</p>
<h3 id="false-start">False Start</h3>
<p>Stat telling a predictable story, then disrupt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disrupt expectations</li>
<li>Show benefits of a flexible approach</li>
<li>Keeping audience engaged</li>
</ul>
<p>"I raised 15M in funding. Assembled a world class team. And after two years of hard work launched a visually stunning video game. But this isn't a story about success. This is a story about failure."</p>
<h3 id="petal-structure">Petal Structure</h3>
<p>Organise multiple stories around central concept.</p>
<ul>
<li>Show how strands are interconnected</li>
<li>Showing how several scenarions relate back to one idea</li>
</ul>
<p>Uses repetition like as with Sparklines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is Slack so successful?</p>
<ul>
<li>One of a kind innovation (IRC, Hipchat)</li>
<li>Brilliant founders? (MS, Google)</li>
<li>Good timing? (Palm, Yahoo)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key takeaways</h2>
<h3 id="find-your-purpose">Find your purpose</h3>
<p>"If someone walked over to your desk and asked you to explain what you were working on, could you?"</p>
<p>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.</p>
<p>You can be confident if it's aligned with your purpose.</p>
<h3 id="find-your-emotions">Find your emotions</h3>
<p>"The best speakers speak from the heart. It is not about what they say, it is about how they make you feel."</p>
<h3 id="find-your-composure">Find your composure</h3>
<p>Nerves are normal.</p>
