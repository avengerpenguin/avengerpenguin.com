Despite being over 50% grey these days, I remember as a child having very
black hair. Not just dark brown, but actually black and clearly enough so
that I remember adults mentioning it.

Except one time I can remember someone correcting me at school one day. After
having described my hair as black, I was told that it wasn't. My whole
perception of myself has been a lie up until that point until this kind
person helped me see that I was simply "very, very, very dark brown".

Of course, that person was right. My hair is not as black as empty space and
as there exist things that are more black in the universe, I cannot actually,
technically say I have black hair.
