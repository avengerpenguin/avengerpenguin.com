Title: Semantic Arguments

What's missing in that hypothetical argument? Something that's missing
in a lot of discussion on the web about this: any concrete discussion
of the properties of the thing originally built.

This happens in multiple fields:

* Is some musical genre "real" music?
* Is modern art really art?
* Is this leader truly left wing?
* Is this programming language really a functional language?

The debate has broken down to arguing the ontological commitments made
by assigning something to a class or category, rather than discuss the
thing originally being discussed. Consider the productive discussions
we could have with each of these examples:

* What musical features are present in this genre of music?
* Do people like modern art? What patterns have emerged that differentiate it from more traditional art forms? What do people feel when they see it?
* What policies does that leader want? what are her values? How does his beliefs match up to past leaders and famous figureheads?
