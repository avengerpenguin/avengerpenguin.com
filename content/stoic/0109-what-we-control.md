Title: What we control and what we don't

Today's (9 January) Daily Stoic insight is based on a core tenet of Stoic
philosophy: accepting there are many things you cannot control, but you are not
powerless because you _can_ control your opinions about things outside of your
control.

This is part of a series inspired by
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0735211736/?tag=multisites-21">The Daily Stoic</a>
and the corresponding
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0735211736/?tag=multisites-21">Daily Stoic Journal</a>.
I followed the journal over the course of 2018 and in 2019 I am doing the
journal again for myself but also blogging my interpretation, critique or
additional thoughts on each days' insights. I will sometimes relate it to
other books or works that have also influenced my thoughts.

In This is clearly stated by the supporting quotation from Epictetus in
Enchiridion Chapter 1:

> Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.

> -- <cite>Epictetus, _Enchiridion_, Chapter 1</cite>
    
The key insight from today -- one that I might have missed when I first
read The Daily Stoic -- is what it is telling you about what you _can_
control. The focus for today is not the difficult task of trying hard to
accept what you cannot control (and therefore try to "let go" of worrying
about these things) but instead it is offering the opportunity to focus
positively on what you can control about a situation: your opinion about it.

If you despair at the state of the world or politics or some disaster happening
in the world. You can choose the opinion of being angry or upset about it
or you can choose to acknowledge that while it is bad, it is out of your
control.

Or is it?

It could be argued that this approach stops short. It does not acknowledge
there are perhaps other thing you can control. Another quotation that came
to mind on reading today's thoughts was:

> It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.
>
> -- <cite>W. L. Watkinson</cite>
    
That is, can we some way to do good in even the darkest of situations or events?

If something is not as you would like it to be, but it seems to be out of
your control, maybe there _is_ something you can still do about it. This
attitude seems perfectly within the ethos of Stoicism too: do not focus on anger
or other emotions about something (i.e. "cursing" the darkness) but instead
act on what you can control in line with virtue and doing what is right.

Dismayed by the state of politics? Join a political party, campaign or
even just write your thoughts for others to read (making a well-articulated
case just the great orators of Ancient Greece and Rome, of course, rather
than getting into passionate, fruitless arguments on social media).

Frustrated by your body and health? For many people there's small habits you
can adopt daily to nudge your health in the right direction if only in small
ways.

Will a single blog in the noise change policitians' minds or steer public
discourse? No. Will eating better help chronic or terminal illnesses? No.

But in the darkness, it is our Stoic duty to light that candle if only to
focus our discipline away from cursing it.
