    "A classic example is that of the biological sciences where we can describe an organ as a _system_ of cells or an organism a _system_ of organs. In the \"Systems\" approach, we can talk about attributes of the whole (holism) without need to describe everything in terms of its smaller parts (reductionism). In the biological example, we can describe the emergent properties of organs or organisms without having to explain how each individual component leads to those properties."
