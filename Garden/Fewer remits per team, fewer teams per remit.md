I coined this for myself as a laudable goal for an engineering organisation after observing the converse for too long.

With many years working at the BBC, but also looking at other companies, I saw a pervasive problem that -- with the wrong culture -- we can reach a point where it feels nearly _impossible_ for anything to get done. Anything that does get done takes months or even _years_ and it's not always even clear why in restrospect.

The hypothesis I formed here is that we have two factors that cause each other:

- People end up being "across" too many concerns or projects
- Projects or remits therefore end up with a lot of people covering them

What this looks like in practice is meetings with 16 people to "align" or agree an approach before a project starts. It looks like people then not following up on actions from regular meetings like this because they're giving their attention to multiple things. It looks like people bike-shedding and giving superficial feedback on things because they don't know enough to discuss it in detail or understand the context.

In short, it looks like an organisation where every initiative has a minimum amount of time to deliver due to having to get all the right people gathered to discuss.

What's the alternative? Autonomy and clear remits for individual teams.

When a team owns a problem space _fully_ (within certain constraints clearly given) and other teams stop having a say in _how_ they solve that space, they can move more quickly. They can experiment with things, try new approaches and feel better job satisfaction from being able to get stuff done.

This is a key aspect of my [[Technical Vision]] for any organisation. With appropriate autonomy, teams get quicker feedback on ideas and try more things.
