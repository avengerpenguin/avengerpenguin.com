I coined this for myself as a laudable goal for an engineering organisation after observing the converse for too long.

With many years working at the BBC, but also looking at other companies, I saw a pervasive problem that -- with the wrong culture -- we can reach a point where it feels nearly _impossible_ for anything to get done. Anything that does get done takes months or even _years_ and it's not always even clear why in restrospect.
