Technical projects, blogs or other ideas that are on my personal "tech radar" as something I may or may not come back to.

To follow conventions from the [Thoughtsworks Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar), I have broken this down into four areas:

- [[Tech Radar - Tools]]
- [[Tech Radar - Platforms]]
- [[Tech Radar - Techniques]]
- [[Tech Radar - Languages & Frameworks]]

There is also a [visual version](/radar/) using the ["Build Your Own Radar" tool from Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar/byor) (with some hackery to publish it here).
