# Tools

## git-xargs

- Status: Adopt

Do commands across multiple Github repos at once. See [gruntwork-io/git-xargs: git-xargs is a command-line tool (CLI) for making updates across multiple Github repositories with a single command.](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/git-xargs)

## Testmon

- Status: Assess

See [About | testmon](https://testmon.org/)

## Diagrams

- Status: Hold

In the spirit of PlantUML, a Python library for generating diagrams with specific icons. What appeals in particular is the C4 shapes as well as cloud-provider-specific icons. See [mingrammer/diagrams: Diagram as Code for prototyping cloud system architectures](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams)

Currently on hold for me since I discovered [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML).

## gitStream

- Status: Assess

A tool to push the idea of "continuous merge". See [gitStream by LinearB Â· GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/gitstream-by-linearb).

## Gatling

- Status: Adopt

JVM-based load testing tool.

## nitpick

- Status: Assess

Potentially useful for enforcing standards across multiple repos.

## tfautomv

- Status: Assess

Looks very useful for big refactors but the need for it hasn't quite come up yet for me. See [busser/tfautomv: Generate Terraform moved blocks automatically for painless refactoring](https://github.com/busser/tfautomv).

## Vanna

- Status: Assess

[GitHub - vanna-ai/vanna: ðŸ¤– Chat with your SQL database ðŸ“Š. Accurate Text-to-SQL Generation via LLMs using RAG ðŸ”„.](https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna)

## Streamlit

- Status: Assess

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) seems an interesting way to present data quickly. I might not be the target audience since the web app part is my forte whereas it looks aimed at people more on the data science side that would struggle to present data in a web app. However, even for engineers a framework that allows certain use cases to be put together quickly can still appeal. I plan to try it out at some point.
