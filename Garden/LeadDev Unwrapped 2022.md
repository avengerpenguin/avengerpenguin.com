Give credit.

Build a network. Give influence to other influencers.

	- Incremental results
	- Willingness to adapt

	- Connect people who need connected
	- Think how you present in meetings or writing
- Relationships
	- Favour gifting -- give someone something they want
- Reducing Complexity
	- Early execution is "depth-first", leadership is "breadth-first"
	- Summarisation:
