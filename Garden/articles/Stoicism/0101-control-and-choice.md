Title: Control, Choice and Habits
Date: 2019-01-01
Slug: control-choice-habits
Tags: Stoicism, Philosophy

Today's (9 January) Daily Stoic insight is based on a core tenet of Stoic
philosophy: accepting there are many things you cannot control, but you are not
powerless because you _can_ control your opinions about things outside of your
control.

This is part of a series inspired by
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0735211736/?tag=multisites-21">The Daily Stoic</a>
and the corresponding
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0735211736/?tag=multisites-21">Daily Stoic Journal</a>.
I followed the journal over the course of 2018 and in 2019 I am doing the
journal again for myself but also blogging my interpretation, critique or
additional thoughts on each days' insights. I will sometimes relate it to
other books or works that have also influenced my thoughts.
