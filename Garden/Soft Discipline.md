An approach to self-discipline where:

- we avoid strict planning
- we avoid micro-managing via a fixed schedule
- rely on deadlines

## "Powering through"

Avoid powering through work you're not enjoying or struggling with. If it's hard, consider if you need to step back and act like a beginner in the task and go back to being playful.

## Personal Tax

Stop beating yourself up for the "tax" of the downside of your personal nature. Instead just accept it as a cost of your strengths from that same nature.

For example, someone impatient and novelty-seeking will struggle with rushing things or impulse-buying, but that same trait makes that person quick to pick up new things and open to trying new things.

## Compensation

If you are making yourself work hard at something, are you compensating yourself enough for it? Are you reaping the benefits and actually enjoying them? Are you taking breaks by doing other things for a bit so you're not flat-out?
