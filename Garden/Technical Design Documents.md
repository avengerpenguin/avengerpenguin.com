A technical design document is a useful way to lay out details of a solution before it is implemented in code.

A key feature for me is the ability to describe trade-offs made so it is clear that alternatives are acknowledged but -- while the problem space is the way it is -- the specific approach described is chosen for now. This implies that a good document will show enough working such that if the situation _does_ change, we might reconsider some decisions.

This borrows nicely from the scientific method in that we are writing things in a way that openly invites falsifiability.
