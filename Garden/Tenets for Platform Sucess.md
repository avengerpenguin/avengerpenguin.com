Following from [Scaling your business with platform thinking by Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/what-we-do/enterprise-modernization-platforms-cloud/empc-hub/scaling-your-business-with-platform-thinking), I got a nice list-based set of "tenets" for how to build a successful platform inside an organisation. They resonated strongly with my own observations and experience so I have added those to the tenets as laid out by Thoughtworks here.

See also [[Platform Pitfalls and Myths]].

## 1. Clear Vision and value hypothesis

- Clear goal
- Aligned with business outcomes and customer value


## 2. Coherent digital platform strategy

- Defining value
- Maximising value


## 3. Product thinking

- Platforms are emergent and evolutionary

## 4. Team Structures

Vertically-aligned teams gain the most.

## 5. Careful with change management
