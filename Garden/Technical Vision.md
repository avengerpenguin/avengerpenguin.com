The technical vision or mission that has been guiding my career could be summed with "Faster Feedback Loops".

This comprises a few principles:

- Culture of experimentation
- Being data-driven
- Optimised lead times
- Frequent releases
- [[Fewer remits per team, fewer teams per remit]]
- Quick hand-offs
- Less context switching
