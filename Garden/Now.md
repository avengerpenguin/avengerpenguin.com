title: What I am doing now

## April 2024

Moving on from my Lead role at INRIX and considering my options for what's next. I've had an interesting year and a half working more hands-on with Terraform and Kubernetes while also guide a team through a DevOps journey.

I'm trying to come back to this [[Digital Garden]] to write more thoughts and spend more time on a new random project with [History ofÂ Sound ](https://historyofsound.com/).

## January 2023

My interest has come back to the idea of a [[Tech Radar]] for myself, for my new team at Inrix and in general for the industry. I've created the [[Tech Radar]] page on this site to act as a way to write up all the little bookmarks of interesting tools and articles I have.

I've done some [forks](https://github.com/avengerpenguin/build-your-own-radar) and PRs on [Thoughtworks' Build Your Own Radar repo](https://github.com/thoughtworks/build-your-own-radar) to allow me to publish the [visual version](/radar/) within this site.

## December 2022

Started my new Lead role at INRIX right in the middle of organising Christmas.

## October 2022

Coming to the end of 12 years working at the BBC and looking forwarding to joining [INRIX](https://inrix.com/) as a Lead Software Developer.

I'm currently revamping my [[Digital Garden]] to auto-publish via Github actions and maybe actually polish up some of the notes.

## October 2021

Having struggling with the friction of writing fully-formed articles for a blog website, I am in the process of transforming this website into a [[Digital Garden]].
