## Synchrony

Avoid the need to talk back and forth all day to keep work done. Instead:

- Regular, standing meeting with a shared document
- Office hours
- Set up processes for certain work

## Control Meeting Availability

Be proactive and helpful in allowing people to book meetings, but at times you're ok with. The aim here is to control your meetings without being annoying or difficult.

Keep the available windows "random" enough as being consistently unavailable, say, after 2pm looks suspicious.

## Sell Processes

Focus on the key area of getting buy-in for the processes you're setting up. If people don't buy in, they will choose to message you.

People may think of all the things that can cause a process to break down, so it's worth having an "escape hatch" of what to do in the worst case. This will appease them and it's highly unlikely you will use it.

## Trade Accountability for Accessibility

Explicitly ask for some drop in accessibility to go off and work on something big so long as you're then accountable for that.

## Monthly Crush

Make sure you do enough deep work on something valuable such that at least once a month you "crush" a project and have something to show. You will gain a lot more autonomy this way.
