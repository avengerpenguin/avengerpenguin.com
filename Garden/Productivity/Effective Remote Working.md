## Retros

Remote retros can be more effective if we maximise the value from the "synchronous" time by doing various things ahead of the call. For example, people can raise all their issues on board, comment on other issues, vote on ones they care about all before an actual video call.

Then the video call is focused on the actual discussion portion.

## 1-to-1 Meetings

Arguably the 1-to-1 meeting is better remote in person. They are automatically private and it's less awkward than having to sit face-to-face.
