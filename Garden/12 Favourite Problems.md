## Personal

1. How can I continue learning all my areas of interest while actually learning some of them in depth?
2. How can I live a life with longer breaks or "mini-retirements"?
3. How do I find or build a community of people that share my values, interests and passions?
4. How do I make physical fitness and training a natural part of my life?
5. How do I get better at doing deep work and sharing it?
6. What is the right approach to balance doing deep, meaningful work and ensuring I am taking time out to rest properly and spend time with family?
7. Do I have areas where I can do significant teaching through talks, writing articles and even writing books?
8. How do I incorporate a significant reading habit into my life such that I actually read all the books I have?

## Tech

9. How do we balance locality and autonomy with the desire to reduce [[Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting]]?
10. Can we restore some of design principles of the World Wide Web (REST, semantics, Linked Data) to APIs and Enterprise Integration and reduce wasted effort on repeated, bespoke integration middlewares?
11. Is it possible to having less than a day between writing code and shipping to production? Can we deploy changes within 10 minutes?

## Wider

12. How might I do more for the world around me? Can I do anything about injustice, climate change, oppression?
