Mostly notes from [Connecting Devs' Work to the Business Bottom Line - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGe35BKuSO0&list=PL0cH8n2pFJ3u7jvJnWkpbdddNtkjAr0EW).

The main thing that helps is focusing on metrics. We will always have more problems than people.

Avoid [[Shipping Theatre]] -- in the absence of clarity (clear metrics, clear impact), we simply celebrate shipping things. You chase the deliverable, not the proof that it helps.

The most important things might be the hardest things. They might need the most collaboration. Those that avoid this will "ship their org chart" and deliver what they can easily and naively deliver without too much collaboration.

Metrics used might vary based on what we are doing:

- Launch a new product? Metrics to show growth, adoption.
- Working on long-standing product? Metrics more focused on how you'd like to grow/improve it.

Weekly review of:

- Innovation pipeline
- Execution review
- Operations and maintenance metrics

Metrics are the start of the story. Generally, they tend to point you at some human element behind the metrics or something in how humans, teams and systems are interacting

Cycle time is a key metric and it shows how quickly code is reaching the customer. Teams that have short cycle times are likely the most efficient.

Speed and resiliency are features in the current era of SaaS and highly connected systems.

Production incidents are an amazing learning tool. Blameless incident write-ups that focus on learning are useful. It can find where we might need to be investing time.

A key initiative is reducing the feedback loop around the gap between the problem and the solution. Things ranging from experiments to zooming in on individual customers will help here.

Makers' Week -- One week a month without standing meetings and people focus on building things for their customers.
