I first heard this term from [James Stanier, Director of Engineering at Shopify](https://twitter.com/jstanier).

As with Security Theatre, we can consider Shipping Theatre to be an over-reliance on the superficialities of shipping product features, but in such a way there is no real impact.

The idea is that a team can only ship the right things with clear metrics and a clear measure of their impact. In the absence of this, teams resort -- perhaps unknowingly -- to focus on just shipping anything.

Teams focus too much on the deliverable, not what the deliverable is intended to do. Shipping and big launches can be celebrated, but don't know whether the launches were worth doing.
