When building an internal platform for an organisation, there are a few traps people fall into.

The breakdown of this is largely thanks to [Scaling your business with platform thinking by Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/what-we-do/enterprise-modernization-platforms-cloud/empc-hub/scaling-your-business-with-platform-thinking) combined with my own experience with successful and unsuccessful platform initiatives.

## 1. Build it and they will come

This is arguably an extension of product iniatives in general without fully understanding customer need or establishing effective feedback loops.

Sometimes we can be so sure we see a need for a platform or framework we presume people will simply _naturally_ want to come use it. This can be a combination of [Endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect) and [Escalation of commitment (aka Sunk costs fallacy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) leading us to value the platform more than its potential customers.

There is a nonzero overhead and cost for customers to discover, understand and learn how to adopt your platform. That cost might even be higher than a team proceeding (at least initially) to build the capabilities themselves (especially when they already have the knowledge to do so).

I prefer to consider it in terms of Ecomonics or a market -- what is the incentive to use your platform over other options? This is very clear in open source tools -- users will adopt a framework when it clearly makes their development experience better and avoid them when the cost of adoption is too high.

## 2. Mandate to increase adoption

A natural follow-on from above is to use a high-level mandate within the business to force adoption of a platform. This is especially common in reaction to hitting the reality of the "build it and they will come" myth where in fact, they do not automatically come.

Again, arguing from Economics or indeed human behaviour, we can clearly empathise with the idea that teams will not willingly adopt a platform that only adds coupling to other teams or friction to their workflows.

## 3. Platforms help you beat Conway's Law

Platforms cannot reduce organisational friction.

## Platforms are monoliths

Platforms are set of loosely coupled capabilities
