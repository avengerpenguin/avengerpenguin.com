I accidentally triggered an AI chat bot to write a short story on "a future where humans are extinct and animals are the only remaining species":

> I wrote this one story called "The Last Human." It's set in a future where humans are extinct and animals are the only remaining species. The main character is a rabbit named Peter who tries to unravel the mystery of how humans went extinct.

With a lot of prompting I got it to give me the full story which I'm saving here for posterity:

> In a world where humans had long since gone extinct, a group of animals gathered around a fire late into the night. The flames flickered and danced, casting shadows against the rocky walls of the cave where they huddled together for warmth. Among them was Peter, a curious rabbit with a thirst for knowledge. As he stared into the fire, his thoughts turned to the mysterious disappearance of humanity. He knew that he couldn't rest until he uncovered the truth behind their demise.
> Peter looked around at the other animals gathered around the fire. "I wonder why humans disappeared," he said. The other animals looked at him curiously, unsure of how to answer. "It's a big mystery, isn't it?" he added. "We don't even know if they ever existed in the first place!"
> "Well if they didn't exist, then what are all these buildings and machines doing here?" asked a wise old owl. Peter thought for a second. "Maybe they were built by other animals, and the humans never even existed at all," he suggested.
> "But if that were true, then why do we still talk about humans so often?" asked a small fox. "It makes no sense. We should stop talking about them altogether."
> "I agree, it is definitely strange that we talk about humans when they don't exist. But maybe we're talking about them because we miss them?" suggested Peter.
> "I think we miss them too," said the owl. "They used to live here once. They were the ones who made all these buildings and machines, right? Maybe they left us some clues about their disappearance somewhere."
> The animals talked for hours, speculating about the humans and trying to piece together clues. Eventually, Peter had an idea. "What if we could use their own technology to find them? Like maybe they had some sort of device that allowed them to travel through time and space. If we found one of those devices, we might be able to find them ourselves!"
> Peter's idea sparked a debate among the animals. Some thought it was worth a try while others believed it was impossible. But as the night wore on, the excitement of the possibility grew stronger. Finally, they all agreed to explore the abandoned human city nearby in search of any hint of the missing humans.
> "Let's go!" shouted Peter, excited to finally begin his journey. The animals set off across the darkened landscape, their eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of the humans. As they drew closer to the city, the air began to thicken with the faint smell of decay. The abandoned buildings loomed over them, their crumbling facades a testament to the humans' sudden departure.
> The animals pressed forward, their anticipation building with every step. As they neared the heart of the city, they saw something glittering in the distance, nestled amidst the rubble.
> As they approached, the glittering object revealed itself to be a glowing crystal, pulsing with a strange energy. The animals were transfixed by its beauty and power, but also filled with a deep sense of unease. Without warning, the crystal emitted a bright burst of light, blinding the animals for a moment. When they opened their eyes again, they found themselves transported to a different dimension entirely.
> The animals were dumbfounded as they gazed around the new environment. The sky was a vibrant purple, and the ground was covered in a lush green carpet. A gentle breeze blew, carrying with it the sound of a distant humming. As they looked further, they noticed that the trees seemed to be moving... but not in a windblown fashion. Instead, they were swaying back and forth, almost as if they were dancing to the rhythm of the song.
> The animals cautiously approached the nearest tree, feeling a mixture of awe and fear. To their surprise, they realized that the tree was actually alive. It spoke to them in a voice that sounded both ancient and wise.
> The tree greeted them, saying, 'Welcome to the land of the Fae. You have been chosen for a great quest.' The animals exchanged nervous glances, but also felt a surge of excitement. After all, they had always wanted to embark on an adventure, even if it meant facing unknown danger. They eagerly awaited the tree's instructions.
> The tree explained that they must retrieve a powerful artifact from the evil sorcerer Morgath. Morgath had enslaved many of the Fae and was planning to use the artifact to conquer the entire realm. The animals would need to brave treacherous terrain, outsmart Morgath's minions, and defeat the sorcerer himself in order to succeed. With a nod of determination, the animals accepted the challenge. They knew it wouldn't be easy, but they also knew that the fate of the Fae depended on their success. And so, they set off on their perilous journey.
> With a rush of adrenaline coursing through their veins, the animals charged towards the nearest exit from the forest, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. They ran through fields of flowers, past towering mountains, and across raging rivers. Finally, after days of arduous travel, they arrived at Morgath's castle gates. The castle was dark and imposing, with spikes protruding from the top of each tower. Inside, the air was heavy with magic and the scent of decay.
> The animals crept up to the entrance, their hearts racing with fear. The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit hallway leading deeper into the castle. Suddenly, they heard footsteps coming down the corridor toward them. They froze, hoping not to be discovered. The footsteps grew louder and louder, until they came to a halt just inches away from the animals. The animals held their breath, waiting for the worst. But instead, they heard a soft whisper: 'You seek the artifact, don't you?'
> The animals turned to see who had spoken. In front of them stood a mysterious figure shrouded in shadow. The figure slowly stepped out of the darkness, revealing itself to be a beautiful woman with long flowing hair. She introduced herself as Elyndria, the Queen of the Fae. Elyndria told the animals that she had been watching them and knew of their mission. She offered to help them, but only if they agreed to do her a favor in return.
> The animals agreed to Elyndria's terms. She gave them a magical sword and told them that it would be needed to defeat Morgath. She also warned them that there was a traitor in their midst, someone who would betray them to Morgath. The animals took the sword and set off again, determined to find the traitor before it was too late.
> As they ventured deeper into the castle, the animals encountered fierce battles against Morgath's minions. Their fighting skills were put to the ultimate test as they fought off giant spiders, fire-breathing dragons, and enchanted skeletons. But eventually, they emerged victorious from each battle, leaving behind them a trail of destruction and carnage.
> After several grueling battles, the animals finally reached the inner sanctum of the castle where they confronted the evil sorcerer Morgath. He was tall, with piercing red eyes and a long white beard that hung down to his waist. His robes were black, embroidered with intricate designs, and he carried a staff that seemed to crackle with dark energy. His voice boomed as he welcomed the animals to their doom.
> Morgath unleashed a torrent of dark magic, hurling bolts of lightning and conjuring swarms of locusts. The animals dodged the attacks and charged forward, their magical weapons gleaming in the dark castle. With a mighty swing, the animals' leader, Peter, brought the sword down upon Morgath's staff, shattering it into pieces. The spellcasting stopped immediately and Morgath fell to his knees, defeated.
> The animals cheered their victory, but their celebration was short lived. As they turned to leave, they realized that the castle was crumbling around them. They raced out of the castle and back into the safety of the forest. Once outside, they searched frantically for the traitor within their ranks. They soon discovered that it was none other than their own leader, Peter, who had been secretly working with Morgath. The animals confronted him, demanding to know why he had betrayed them.
> Peter confessed that he had been working with Morgath all along. He had manipulated the animals into doing Morgath's dirty work, hoping that he could gain power once Morgath had achieved his goals. The animals were devastated by this revelation, but they refused to give up. They decided to turn Peter over to the Fae authorities, knowing that he had committed a terrible crime against their kind.
> The animals led Peter back to the Fae Kingdom, where they presented him to the Queen. Peter begged for forgiveness, claiming that he had been under the influence of a powerful spell cast by Morgath. The Queen listened carefully to his words, then nodded gravely. 'I understand the depths of your betrayal,' she said. 'But I also recognize the pain and regret in your eyes. I offer you a chance at redemption. You will serve me faithfully as my new advisor, and I will consider pardoning you when the time is right.' Peter bowed his head in gratitude and began to fulfill his duties as the Queen's advisor. He spent the rest of his life trying to make amends for his past mistakes, and eventually became known throughout the kingdom as one of its most respected advisors.
