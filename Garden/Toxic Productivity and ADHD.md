Inspired by [Avoiding Toxic Productivity Advice for ADHD: Find What Actually Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsT3KPYJFl4)

Productivity systems like Getting Things Done or 43 Folders are designed for their authors.

A big flaw in most of these traditional systems is that they reduce anxiety by creating trust that you will get to things. This is difficult for people with ADHD who might not trust themselves like that.

Three additional flaws:

- Most systems require motivation and for ADHD people, long term rewards, etc. don't motivate in a neurotypical way
- Distrations are bad for people with ADHD and most productivity systems come loaded _with_ distrations with all the bits you can tweak and tune
- Overwhelm is an issue where if you gather everything in one place, the brain can shut down and it's near impossible to make the choice to make progress

The example of "eat the frog" (do the really hard thing first) can be dangerous if it causes you to get blocked all day not able to start that thing.

Breaking a big project into steps sounds logical, but it increases the overwhelm as the project seems to grow to an infinite size.

So, instead of the neurotypical motivations of:

- Important
- Consequences
- Rewards

People with ADHD may wish to consider instead:

- Captivate -- Something that captures your interest.
- Create -- Something novel you want to dive into and provides dopamine.
- Compete -- A good challenge or a competition with someone else. Someone telling you that you can't do it can be a great motivator.
- Complete -- Deadlines, urgency, panic.

Strategies to use according to Jessie J. Anderson:

- Embrace the pivot (captivate, create) -- Accept any new system is going to fail and you will abandon it, therefore simply do not pour everything into it; use it lightly so you are ready to pivot to the next system
- Pomodoro Timers -- Create short deadlines with burst of 20-40 mins of work
- Look for sidequests -- Being careful not to get derailed, you can still find a side angle on a project that is more interesting.
- Micro commitments -- Commit to small amounts of progress only
- Change your environment -- simply working somewhere different can help (e.g. coffee shop)
- Making tests or paperwork into a game -- Do questions in reverse order, mix it up in other ways, etc.
- Make time-based goals -- Instead of "write 1000 words", say "write for 20 mins"; instead of "clean the whole office", say "I'll spend 10 mins cleaning"
