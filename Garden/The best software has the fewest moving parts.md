Dave Farley has said at various times "the ability to change your software is the is the defining characteristic of its quality". This comes up for example in [The Ultimate Quality Of GOOD Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnL_vl2oBag).

Combining this idea with a sprinkling of [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) we get a principle that we should largely favour _less_ in software engineering wherever possible.
