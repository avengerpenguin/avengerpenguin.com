# Languages & Frameworks

## Sanic

- Status: Assess

Sanic is a Python web server and web framework that's written to go fast. See [Sanic on Github](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic).

## Quart

- Status: Assess

See [Quart docs](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/index.html).

## IDOM

- Status: Hold

It's React, but in Python! While interesting, I'm yet to think this is a good idea over, say, htmx. See [IDOM docs](https://ryanmorshead.com/articles/2021/idom-react-but-its-python/article/)

## htmx

- Status: Trial

A solid attempt to extend HTML affordances in a standard way user agents could well support natively in future. I think this is a strong approach than bloated UI frameworks like React. See [</> htmx - high power tools for html](https://htmx.org/).

## Typer

- Status: Adopt

See [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).
