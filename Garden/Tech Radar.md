Technical projects, blogs or other ideas that are on my personal "tech radar" as something I may or may not come back to.

To follow conventions from the [Thoughtsworks Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar), I have broken this down into four areas:

- [[Tech Radar - Tools]]
- [[Tech Radar - Platforms]]
- [[Tech Radar - Techniques]]
- [[Tech Radar - Languages & Frameworks]]

You can see this visually at [Thoughtworks' "Build your own radar"](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Favengerpenguin.com%2Fradar.json)
