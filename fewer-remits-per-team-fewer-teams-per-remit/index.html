    <h1>Fewer remits per team, fewer teams per remit</h1>
    

    <p>I coined this for myself as a laudable goal for an engineering organisation after observing the converse for too long.</p>
<p>With many years working at the BBC, but also looking at other companies, I saw a pervasive problem that -- with the wrong culture -- we can reach a point where it feels nearly <em>impossible</em> for anything to get done. Anything that does get done takes months or even <em>years</em> and it's not always even clear why in restrospect.</p>
<p>The hypothesis I formed here is that we have two factors that cause each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>People end up being "across" too many concerns or projects</li>
<li>Projects or remits therefore end up with a lot of people covering them</li>
</ul>
<p>What this looks like in practice is meetings with 16 people to "align" or agree an approach before a project starts. It looks like people then not following up on actions from regular meetings like this because they're giving their attention to multiple things. It looks like people bike-shedding and giving superficial feedback on things because they don't know enough to discuss it in detail or understand the context.</p>
<p>In short, it looks like an organisation where every initiative has a minimum amount of time to deliver due to having to get all the right people gathered to discuss.</p>
<p>What's the alternative? Autonomy and clear remits for individual teams.</p>
<p>When a team owns a problem space <em>fully</em> (within certain constraints clearly given) and other teams stop having a say in <em>how</em> they solve that space, they can move more quickly. They can experiment with things, try new approaches and feel better job satisfaction from being able to get stuff done.</p>
<p>This is a key aspect of my <a href="/technical-vision/">Technical Vision</a> for any organisation. With appropriate autonomy, teams get quicker feedback on ideas and try more things.</p>
